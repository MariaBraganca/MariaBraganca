### Hi, I'm Maria! ðŸ‘‹ 

Throughout my professional experience as an architect iâ€™ve explored the benefits of **agile management** on building design. 

Driven by Berlinâ€™s startup scene spirit, Iâ€™ve created a Meetup group called **Berlin Architectural Network** and applied the knowledge from the **Bootcamp at Le Wagon** into building a social platform for architects.

Now Iâ€™m looking forward to resume my career journey as a **software architect** by building apps that bring people together!

### Skills and Interests ðŸ§ 

I feel very comfortable about designing things. I believe that the process of planing a building is very similar to the one of building an app. 

I enjoy the dialog with clients, the architecture of a complex database, the problem solving activity behind coding as well as the challenge of creating appealing and accessible design.
