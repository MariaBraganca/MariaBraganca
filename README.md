### Why you should hire me 💪

<strong>Agile Mindset</strong> 🏁<br>
Throughout my professional experience, as an architect, I've coordinated team members and used Scrum as a framework for my projects. 
Books such as
<ul>
	<li style="list-style: none;">📕 "The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time" from Jeff Sutherland and</li>
	<li style="list-style: none;">📕 "The Scrum Field Guide" from Mitch Lacey</li>
</ul>
helped me build an agile mindset!
 
<strong>Full-stack</strong> 💼<br>
As a developer, I enjoy the 
<ul>
	<li style="list-style: none;">💿 the architecture of a complex database</li>
	<li style="list-style: none;">🧠 the problem solving behind coding as well as</li>
	<li style="list-style: none;">💻 the challenge of creating appealing and accessible design.</li>
</ul>
My working experience as an architect combined with the technical knowledge acquired at the bootcamp, makes me suitable for both Front- and Backend tasks.
 
<strong>Fast Learner</strong> ⚡<br>
Curiosity was always my motivation to keep on learning. Both, my 
<ul>
	<li style="list-style: none;">🔟 year old subscription by lynda.com (now Linkedin Learning) and my</li>
	<li style="list-style: none;">📚extensive library at home</li>
</ul>
classify me as a fast and passionate learner. 
Yet, it was foremost through mentors and teamwork that I’ve grown personally and professionally.
