### Hello, World! 👋 I'm Maria.

In 2020 I chose to pivot my career toward a path that had long fascinated me: software development.<br>
I've graduated from the <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/berlin/web-development-course/full-time">Web Development Bootcamp at Le Wagon</a> in Berlin and have been working as a Backend Engineer since then.<br>
This experience gave me the opportunity to work on apps that are fun to use and are written in code that's maintainable and easy to read.

I'm committed to continuous learning and looking forward to joining teams that are at the forefront of technology and innovation.

### How I can add value within your company 💪

<strong>Full Stack</strong> 🌈<br>
As a developer, I enjoy the 
- 💿 the architecture of a complex database
- 🧠 the problem solving process behind writing efficient code 
- 💻 the challenge of creating appealing and accessible design

My previous working experience as an architect combined with the technical knowledge acquired at the bootcamp, makes me suitable for both Front- and Backend tasks.<br>

<strong>Agile Mindset</strong> 🏁<br>
Throughout my professional journey, I've always strived to work as efficient as possible.
I've first introduced agile principles into architecture for project management, and am now applying them to every software development project.<br>
Books such as
- 📕 "The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time" from Jeff Sutherland and
- 📕 "The Scrum Field Guide" from Mitch Lacey

inspired me to develop an agile mindset!<br> 

<strong>Fast Learner</strong> ⚡<br>
Problem solving was always my motivation to keep on learning. Both, my
- 🔟 year old subscription by lynda.com (now Linkedin Learning) and my
- 📚extensive library at home

classify me as a fast and passionate learner.

Yet, it was foremost through mentors and teamwork that I’ve grown personally and professionally.
