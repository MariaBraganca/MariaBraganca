### Hello, World! 👋 I'm Maria.

In 2020 I chose to pivot my career toward a path that had long fascinated me: software development.<br>
I've graduated from the <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/berlin/web-development-course/full-time">Web Development Bootcamp at Le Wagon</a> in Berlin and have been working as a Backend Engineer ever since.<br>
This experience gave me the opportunity to work on apps that are fun to use and are written in code that's maintainable and easy to read.

I'm looking forward to joining teams that are at the forefront of technology and innovation.
