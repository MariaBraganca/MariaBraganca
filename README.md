### Hi, I'm Maria! ðŸ‘‹ 

Driven by Berlinâ€™s startup scene spirit, Iâ€™ve created a Meetup group called **Berlin Architectural Network** and applied the knowledge from the **Bootcamp at Le Wagon** into building a social platform for architects.
Throughout my professional experience as an architect iâ€™ve explored the benefits of **agile management** on building design as well. 

Now Iâ€™m looking forward to continue my journey as a **software architect** on building apps that bring people together!

### Skills and Interests 

I feel very comfortable about designing things. I believe that the process of planing a building is very similar to the one of building an app. 

I enjoy the dialog with clients, the architecture of a complex database, the problem solving activity behind coding as well as the challenge of creating appealing and accessible design.
