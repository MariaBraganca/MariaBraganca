### Hello, World! 👋 I'm Maria.

I'm an architect who has recently graduated from a <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/berlin/web-development-course/full-time">Web Development Bootcamp at Le Wagon</a> in Berlin.<br>
This experience gave me the opportunity to create apps that are fun to use and are written in code that's maintainable and easy to read.

Now I’m looking forward to working alongside developers and designers and broadening my knowledge on web development.

### I can add value to your company 💪

<strong>Agile Mindset</strong> 🏁<br>
Throughout my professional experience, as an architect, I've coordinated team members and used Scrum as a framework for my projects.<br>
Books such as
- 📕 "The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time" from Jeff Sutherland and
- 📕 "The Scrum Field Guide" from Mitch Lacey

helped me build an agile mindset!<br> 

<strong>Full Stack</strong> 💼<br>
As a developer, I enjoy the 
- 💿 the architecture of a complex database
- 🧠 the problem solving behind coding as well as
- 💻 the challenge of creating appealing and accessible design.

My working experience as an architect combined with the technical knowledge acquired at the bootcamp, makes me suitable for both Front- and Backend tasks.<br>

<strong>Fast Learner</strong> ⚡<br>
Curiosity was always my motivation to keep on learning. Both, my
- 🔟 year old subscription by lynda.com (now Linkedin Learning) and my
- 📚extensive library at home

classify me as a fast and passionate learner.

Yet, it was foremost through mentors and teamwork that I’ve grown personally and professionally.
