### Hello, World! 👋 I'm Maria.

I'm a Senior Backend Engineer with nearly 4.5 years of professional experience, starting with Ruby on Rails and later working extensively with Python and FastAPI in production. I currently contribute to the backend architecture and data pipelines of a microservices-based analytics platform, and was recently promoted to Senior Engineer I based on ownership and impact.

I transitioned into tech after working as an architect. I was active in the design community, even founding a Meetup group with over 600 members. Early on, I introduced agile principles like Scrum into that field to improve collaboration and team efficiency. That mindset still influences how I approach software today

Outside of work, I enjoy building side projects that explore the intersection of AI and web development. My latest app, Immobyte, integrates ChatGPT into a Django-based real estate platform. I'm passionate about clean backend design, learning new domains like AI, and growing toward architectural leadership.

Technical Skills:
Python, Ruby, FastAPI, Django, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Redis, Docker, AWS, GitHub Actions

Always learning. Always building.
